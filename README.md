# CV Generator
This is an application that allows you to enter data of your CV and generate one with a default format, which is the same all the time.

It has validations in all the fields, once you fill all of them, then you click in the "generate" button, and then the CV is generated.

**Note:** The fields skills, education, certifications, work experience and languages, require the data being entered a separated-by-commas format; that means, if you have multiples certifications, you have to specify one by one separated by commas, so the app will take all the data and will show it correctly.

This application is made using HTML, Bootstrap, a bit of CSS and JavaScript.
